# COVID-19 Global Case Tracker

Welcome to the COVID-19 Global Case Tracker, a Java Spring Boot web application designed to provide up-to-date information on COVID-19 cases worldwide. This project showcases my proficiency in Java and Spring Boot, as well as my ability to create a robust web application with a server-based CSV data extraction and parsing system.

## Project Overview

In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, I developed this web app to empower users with accurate and timely information on the spread of the virus. Leveraging Java, Spring Boot, and Thymeleaf templating, the application offers a user-friendly interface for tracking COVID-19 cases globally.

## Key Features

### 1. Server-Based CSV Data Extraction and Parsing

The core of this project revolves around a server-based CSV data extraction and parsing system. This mechanism allows the application to retrieve the latest COVID-19 case data from reliable sources. The system is designed for efficiency, ensuring a seamless and accurate update of information.

### 2. HTTP-Based Data Retrieval System

I engineered a robust HTTP-based data retrieval system that efficiently processes and updates COVID-19 case information every 24 hours. This ensures that users have access to the most recent statistics, contributing to informed decision-making and public awareness.

### 3. Java Spring Boot Framework

The application is built on the Spring Boot framework, taking advantage of its simplicity and convention-over-configuration approach. Spring Boot facilitates rapid development and enables the creation of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

### 4. Thymeleaf Templating for Dynamic UI

Thymeleaf templating is employed to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. This allows for seamless integration of server-side variables into the HTML, enabling real-time updates of COVID-19 statistics without the need for page reloads.
